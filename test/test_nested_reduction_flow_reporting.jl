#=
Flow reporting for reduction aggregates that contain other reduction aggregates.

`DegreeTwoReduction` deliberately builds two nested shapes (PNM `degree_two_reduction.jl`,
and PNM's own `test_nested_reduction_aggregates.jl`):

  - a parallel group as a chain segment -- `BranchesSeries` holding a `BranchesParallel`
  - sibling chains in parallel          -- `BranchesParallel{BranchesSeries}`

and the two compose, giving a `BranchesParallel{BranchesSeries}` whose chains themselves
carry a parallel segment.

PowerFlows expands an aggregate arc back to its physical branches in two places, and both
descend only into the first shape:

  - AC:  `_compute_segment_flows` (`post_processing.jl`), which special-cases
    `segment isa AbstractBranchesParallel` inside the `BranchesSeries` method but hands every
    member of a `AbstractBranchesParallel` straight to `_segment_flow_entry`.
  - DC/PTDF: `_distribute_arc_flows`, with the same asymmetry.

So a chain nested inside a parallel group is never descended into. Because
`AbstractReductionAggregate <: PSY.ACTransmission` (PNM `definitions.jl`), the chain is
accepted by the leaf-branch method signatures rather than rejected at the PowerFlows
boundary, and the failure surfaces deep in PSY as `get_r(::BranchesSeries, ::SystemBaseUnit)`
(AC) or as the `result.count == n_branches` assertion (DC/PTDF).

The first shape is covered here as a passing test; the other two are `@test_broken`. Real
datasets rarely nest this far -- ACTIVSg2000 under `DegreeTwoReduction` has 410 parallel
groups, none of them parallel-of-chains, and 7 chains with a parallel segment -- so this is
documented rather than fixed.
