# Fast/Fixed Decoupled Power Flow

[`FastDecoupledACPowerFlow`](@ref) is a *solver* (not a formulation): it
replaces the per-iteration Jacobian refactorization of the Newton family with
constant matrices that are factored **once** and reused across every iteration
*and* every time step. It implements the classic fast decoupled power flow
(fixed-slope decoupled Newton-Raphson), the algorithm most commercial
power-flow tools provide. It works with all
three AC formulations ([`ACPolarPowerFlow`](@ref),
[`ACRectangularPowerFlow`](@ref), [`ACMixedPowerFlow`](@ref)).

The variant and the ``B'``/``B''`` scheme are **type parameters** of the solver —
`FastDecoupledACPowerFlow{V<:FDVariant, S<:FDScheme}` — so they are selected by
multiple dispatch rather than runtime flags. The two variants are:

  - **[`FDDecoupled`](@ref)** (polar only, the default for
    [`ACPolarPowerFlow`](@ref)): the classic ``B'``/``B''`` half-iteration scheme.
  - **[`FDFixedJacobian`](@ref)** (default for the rectangular and mixed
    formulations, also available on polar): a frozen full Jacobian — the
    "constant-matrix" or "dishonest" Newton method.

The bare `FastDecoupledACPowerFlow` (no type parameters) picks these
per-formulation defaults; write `FastDecoupledACPowerFlow{FDDecoupled, FDSchemeBX}`
to choose explicitly.

## The exactness-of-fixed-point argument

The single most important property of this solver — the one that de-risks the
whole design — is that the fast decoupled iteration evaluates the **exact**
residual ``R_v`` every iteration. The constant ``B'``/``B''`` matrices (or the
frozen Jacobian) only *precondition the update*; they never enter the
convergence test. Convergence is declared on exactly the same criterion as
every other solver in the package,

```math
\lVert R_v \rVert_\infty < \texttt{tol}, \qquad \texttt{tol} = 10^{-9}\ \text{(default)},
```

evaluated on the raw mismatch vector. An approximate Jacobian therefore changes
the *rate* of convergence (linear instead of Newton's quadratic), but the
converged *solution* is identical to the one Newton-Raphson finds, to the same
tolerance. A worse approximation simply costs more iterations; it does not move
the fixed point. This is why a deliberately crude constant matrix is safe: the
residual is the arbiter, the matrix is only a step direction.

The practical consequences:

  - Results match the Newton solvers to tolerance at the same `tol` (validated
    to `TIGHT_TOLERANCE`).
  - All downstream quantities derived from the converged state (bus voltages,
    line flows, reactive outputs, Q-limit switching, loss and
    voltage-stability factors) are computed from the *exact* state, not from
    the approximation.
  - The only thing the approximation can do is fail to converge (or converge
    slowly) on a stressed system — which the safeguards and the optional
    handoff are designed to handle.

## The ``B'``/``B''`` derivation (polar `:decoupled`)

The polar power-balance Jacobian has the block structure

```math
\begin{bmatrix} \Delta P \\ \Delta Q \end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix} H & N \\ M & L \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} \Delta \theta \\ \Delta V / V \end{bmatrix} .
```

Two empirical facts about transmission networks justify decoupling:

 1. Active power is strongly coupled to angle and weakly to magnitude
    (``\lVert N \rVert \ll \lVert H \rVert``); reactive power is strongly
    coupled to magnitude and weakly to angle (``\lVert M \rVert \ll \lVert L \rVert``). Dropping ``N`` and ``M`` splits the solve into two independent
    half-systems.
 2. Under the operating assumptions of fast decoupled load flow
    (``\cos\theta_{ik} \approx 1``, ``G_{ik}\sin\theta_{ik} \ll B_{ik}``,
    ``Q_i \ll B_{ii} V_i^2``), the remaining blocks ``H`` and ``L`` reduce to
    *constant*, voltage-independent susceptance matrices, after normalizing the
    mismatches by ``V``:

```math
\frac{\Delta P}{V} = B' \, \Delta\theta, \qquad
\frac{\Delta Q}{V} = B'' \, \Delta V .
```

``B'`` is restricted to the non-reference buses (PV ∪ PQ angle rows/columns);
``B''`` is restricted to the PQ buses (the only buses whose magnitude is
unknown). Each iteration is a **pair of half-steps** — first the ``P``–``\theta``
half-step with magnitudes held fixed, then the ``Q``–``V`` half-step with the
just-updated angles held fixed — and the exact mismatch is re-evaluated after
*each* half-step. This strict ``P\to Q`` alternation, with the mid-cycle
refresh, is a well-established technique that prevents the convergence *cycling*
seen on some systems; it is deliberately not "optimized" away.

In this package, ``B'`` and ``B''`` are defined as constant approximations of
the codebase's **own** Jacobian sub-blocks, and the update mirrors the Newton
solve-then-negate convention. The sign and value contract is settled by a unit
test, not by textbook convention: on a lossless, shunt-free, nominal-tap
network at flat start the decoupling is *exact*, so ``B'`` and ``B''`` must equal
the corresponding exact Jacobian blocks to machine precision (and there XB = BX).

### What each scheme neglects: XB vs BX

``B'`` and ``B''`` are each built by stamping a *temporary* network from the
recovered per-branch parameters and taking ``-\mathrm{Im}(Y_\text{bus})`` of the
restricted submatrix. The two matrices neglect different physical effects, and
the two schemes differ only in *where the series resistance is neglected*:

| Stamped into               | ``B'`` (``P``–``\theta``)                  | ``B''`` (``Q``–``V``)    |
|:-------------------------- |:------------------------------------------ |:------------------------ |
| Line charging ``b_c``      | **neglected** (set to 0)                   | retained                 |
| Bus shunts                 | **neglected** (set to 0)                   | retained                 |
| Off-nominal tap magnitude  | **neglected** (``\lvert\tau\rvert = 1``)   | retained                 |
| Phase shift ``\angle\tau`` | retained (makes ``B'`` mildly unsymmetric) | **neglected** (set to 0) |
| Series resistance ``r``    | **XB:** neglected here                     | **BX:** neglected here   |

  - **[`FDSchemeXB`](@ref)** (the default): resistance is
    neglected in ``B'`` (each series admittance is replaced by ``1/(jx)``), kept
    in ``B''``.
  - **[`FDSchemeBX`](@ref)**: resistance is kept in ``B'``,
    neglected in ``B''``.

On normal-``r/x`` systems the two schemes take essentially the same iteration
count; `:BX` tends to be more robust when problematic ``r/x`` ratios are present.
``B'`` is symmetric except when phase shifters are present; ``B''`` is always
symmetric. Both are block-diagonal (and nonsingular per island) across a
multi-island network, so a single factorization covers every island.

These zeroing rules follow the standard XB/BX stamping, and the mismatch
normalization (``\Delta P/V``, ``\Delta Q/V``; ``P`` rows at PV ∪ PQ, ``Q`` rows
at PQ; factor-once LU; negated updates) is the conventional fast-decoupled form.
One deliberate choice: rather than converging on the ``V``-normalized mismatches,
this package keeps the package-wide raw ``\lVert R_v \rVert_\infty`` criterion (a
raw MW/MVAr mismatch test, as common commercial tools use); the two are identical
at ``\lvert V\rvert \approx 1`` pu.

## The `:fixed_jacobian` variant

The frozen-Jacobian variant generalizes the fixed-slope idea to all three
formulations. The full formulation Jacobian is evaluated once at the initial
state, factored once, and that factorization is reused for every subsequent
update:

```math
J(x_0)\, \Delta x = R_v(x_k), \qquad x_{k+1} = x_k - \Delta x ,
```

with ``R_v(x_k)`` the **exact** residual at the current iterate but ``J`` frozen
at ``x_0``. This is the well-known constant-matrix ("dishonest") Newton method,
which is competitive with — and on high-``r/x`` systems
often better-iterating than — the XB/BX decoupled schemes.

It is the natural default for the rectangular and mixed formulations because
their off-diagonal Jacobian blocks are *already* the constant admittance-matrix
entries (see [Mixed Current-Power Balance Formulation](@ref)); freezing the
Jacobian then only affects the diagonal blocks. Because the LCC HVDC state
variables and the distributed-slack column live inside the frozen Jacobian,
**`:fixed_jacobian` supports LCC systems and distributed slack with no special
handling** — it spans the trailing LCC state variables directly (the *unified*
AC–DC approach). The polar `:decoupled` half-iterations cannot span those
converter states in B′/B″, so they instead solve LCC by the *sequential* AC–DC
method (see [Sequential AC–DC for LCC HVDC](@ref) below). If the frozen-Jacobian
iteration stalls, the solver may (by default) re-evaluate and re-factor the
Jacobian once at the current iterate and continue — a single "refreeze" before
giving up.

## Sequential AC–DC for LCC HVDC

The polar `:decoupled` ``B'``/``B''`` half-steps span only the AC bus state, not
the per-converter LCC control variables (rectifier/inverter tap and thyristor
angle). Rather than reject LCC systems, the `:decoupled` variant solves them by
the **sequential (alternating) AC–DC method**:

 1. **Converter sub-solve** — holding the AC terminal voltages fixed, each LCC's
    control equations (P-setpoint, DC-line balance, the two α limits) are solved
    by a small per-converter Newton step for its tap/angle state. This produces
    the converter's equivalent injection at its AC terminals (the DC boundary
    conditions).
 2. **AC half-steps** — the ``B'``/``B''`` cycle solves the AC network with those
    converter injections in place.

These two alternate every cycle, so a converged result satisfies both the AC
mismatch and the converter control equations (both live in the global
``\lVert R_v \rVert_\infty`` test). The same physics is solved *simultaneously*
inside the frozen Jacobian by `:fixed_jacobian`; the sequential form just moves
the converter solve into an outer loop so the cheap ``B'``/``B''`` factorization
is preserved. Sequential convergence weakens when the AC–DC coupling is strong
(low short-circuit ratio) or when a converter sits behind a very-low-reactance
branch; use a `handoff_solver` or `:fixed_jacobian` for those cases.

## Caching across iterations and time steps

This is the central performance contract of fast decoupled power flow.
The ``B'`` matrix depends only on the network, never on the bus voltages, so it
is factored **once per (data, scheme, backend) lifetime** and reused across all
iterations, all Q-limit retries, and all time steps. The ``B''`` matrix depends
only on the PQ set, so it is refactored *only* when a bus switches between
voltage-regulating (PV) and reactive-power-limited (PQ) status — a small,
millisecond-scale refactorization even at ten thousand buses. This factor-once
cache applies to the polar `:decoupled` ``B'``/``B''`` only. The
`:fixed_jacobian` variant cannot reuse a factorization across time steps: its
frozen Jacobian is evaluated at the per-step starting point, which changes each
step, so it is refactored once per solve.

The effect on repeated-solve workloads (multi-period dispatch, contingency
screening) is dramatic: across time steps with identical bus-type columns, and
across Q-limit retries that return to a previously-seen PQ set, there are **zero
refactorizations**. The start-up cost (building and factoring the fixed
matrices) is higher than a single Newton iteration, but it is amortized over the
whole study.

## Handoff to an exact-Newton solver (opt-in)

Pure fast decoupled is the default and converges to the full `tol` on its own.
But because the FD-stage state is a valid iterate of the *exact* residual, it is
also an excellent warm start for an exact-Newton solver. The solver can
optionally hand off: run the cheap FD stage to a looser `handoff_tol`, then let
[`NewtonRaphsonACPowerFlow`](@ref), [`TrustRegionACPowerFlow`](@ref), or
[`LevenbergMarquardtACPowerFlow`](@ref) polish the solution to `tol` using the
*same* residual and state-vector objects (a
verified drop-in — no data is copied or re-initialized).

```julia
using PowerFlows

# Pure fast decoupled (polar, XB) — converges to tol = 1e-9 on its own:
pf = ACPowerFlow{FastDecoupledACPowerFlow}()
results = solve_power_flow(pf, system)

# FD stage to engineering tolerance, then Newton-Raphson to 1e-9:
pf = ACPowerFlow{FastDecoupledACPowerFlow}(;
    solution_parameters = SolutionParameters(;
        handoff_solver = NewtonRaphsonACPowerFlow,
        handoff_tol = 1e-3,
    ),
)
results = solve_power_flow(pf, system)

# BX scheme (a solver type parameter), hand off to Trust Region:
pf = ACPowerFlow{FastDecoupledACPowerFlow{FDDecoupled, FDSchemeBX}}(;
    solution_parameters = SolutionParameters(;
        handoff_solver = TrustRegionACPowerFlow,
    ),
)
results = solve_power_flow(pf, system)

# Fixed-slope (frozen-Jacobian) on the mixed formulation — supports LCC, distributed slack:
pf = ACMixedPowerFlow{FastDecoupledACPowerFlow}()    # rect/mixed default to FDFixedJacobian
results = solve_power_flow(pf, system)
```

The `handoff_tol` default (`1e-3` pu ≈ 0.1 MW/MVAr on a 100 MVA base) is a
typical engineering convergence tolerance: the FD stage exits there and the
refinement stage continues to the package's `1e-9`. If the FD stage already
reaches `tol`, the handoff is skipped. This staging — fast decoupled as a cheap
conditioner, Newton as the closer — is standard practice in commercial
power-flow tools.

A cross-formulation composition (e.g. a polar FD solve warm-starting a
rectangular Newton solve) already works without any dedicated API: the residual
functor syncs ``V``/``\theta`` into the shared data container, and every
formulation's warm-start reads from that container. Run the two solves in
sequence.

## Safeguards on stressed systems

Fast decoupled divergence on high-``r/x`` or heavily-stressed cases is *expected
algorithm behavior*, not a bug: the iteration typically reaches some mismatch
level and then stalls or slowly diverges. The solver ships the usual safeguards
rather than a promise of unconditional convergence:

  - **Non-divergent backtracking** (default on): each cycle, if the
    sum-of-squared mismatches fails to improve, the step is halved and re-tried
    (up to ten halvings); on exhaustion the iteration terminates while
    **restoring the best-mismatch state seen** into the data — a good
    starting point for a handoff, and a useful localization of trouble spots.
  - **BLOWUP** abort on an oversized per-half-step ``\lvert\Delta\theta\rvert``
    or ``\lvert\Delta V/V\rvert`` (the only divergence guard when non-divergent
    control is disabled).
  - **DVLIM** clamping that uniformly scales the ``\Delta V`` vector so the
    largest applied magnitude change stays bounded, plus a ``\Delta V/V \le -1``
    positivity guard.
  - A **``\lvert V\rvert \approx 0`` abort** if any bus magnitude is driven to
    nearly zero.

When a handoff solver is configured, a stalled FD stage still hands its
best-recorded state to the Newton solver, which frequently converges from
there. In pure-FD mode a stall returns a non-converged result (no exception)
with an actionable error suggesting `:BX`, `:fixed_jacobian`, a handoff, or a
Newton solver.

## When to use which solver

Rules of thumb:

  - **Repeated solves at scale** are the prime use case for fast decoupled: the
    ``B'`` factorization is shared across every time step, so the higher
    start-up cost is amortized and the total wall time is competitive with — or
    better than — re-running Newton each step.
  - For a **single, well-conditioned solve**, plain Newton-Raphson is usually as
    fast or faster (its quadratic rate needs only a handful of refactorizations).
  - For a **stressed or high-``r/x``** system, prefer `:BX`, `:fixed_jacobian`,
    a handoff to Trust Region, or one of the robust solvers directly.
  - **LCC HVDC under fast decoupled:** `:fixed_jacobian` solves it unified; the
    polar `:decoupled` variant solves it by the sequential AC–DC method and may
    need a `handoff_solver` on stiff converters.

## Scope

Commercial fast-decoupled implementations bundle automatic tap, switched-shunt,
and area-interchange adjustment loops, and remote/droop voltage control. These
are out of scope for this solver — as they are for every other solver in the
package — and are listed here as future work. Optimized fast decoupled for
contingency analysis (reusing the base-case ``B'`` across contingencies with
compensation correction vectors) is likewise future work that this
implementation enables.

## Background

Fast decoupled power flow (the XB and BX schemes), the constant-matrix
("dishonest") Newton method behind the `:fixed_jacobian` variant, the
fixed-``B'``/switching-``B''`` caching contract, the standard
non-divergent/BLOWUP/DVLIM safeguards, and the sequential AC–DC handling of LCC
HVDC are all long-established, widely-documented power-system algorithms; this
implementation follows the conventional formulations. The XB/BX stamping and the
factor-once iteration match the open-source MATPOWER reference (`makeB.m`,
`fdpf.m`).
