# Validating a UC Dispatch with Multi-Period Power Flow

To get started, ensure you have followed the [installation instructions](@ref "Installation"). Start Julia from the command line if you haven't already.

In this tutorial, you'll run a 24-interval DC power flow over a set of dispatch results
from a unit commitment (UC) problem, then scan every interval for overloaded branches.

Unit commitment determines which generators are online and at what output level for each
hour of a planning horizon. UC models typically use a simplified network representation
(e.g., Power Transfer Distribution Factor linearization). Running a power flow at every dispatch interval lets you
check whether the committed schedule is network-feasible — no line overloads, angle
differences within limits, etc.

If you want to run power flow automatically *during* a [`PowerSimulations.jl`](https://nrel-sienna.github.io/PowerSimulations.jl/stable/) UC simulation rather than
after it, see the tutorial [Running Power Flow In The Loop with Unit Commitment](@ref).

## Setup

Load the needed packages:

```@repl uc_validation
using PowerSystemCaseBuilder
using PowerFlows
using PowerSystems
using DataFrames
using Logging
disable_logging(Logging.Warn)
```

Build a 14-bus test system:

```@repl uc_validation
sys = build_system(PSITestSystems, "c_sys14")
```

!!! warning "Run the setup blocks first"
    Every code block in this tutorial shares the same REPL session (`uc_validation`). If you
    skip or re-order blocks, variables like `sys`, `pf`, and `data` will be undefined and
    you will see `UndefVarError`. Always run the setup blocks above before proceeding to
    each subsequent section.

    If any `using` statement in the setup block failed because a package was not yet
    installed, install it with `Pkg.add("PackageName")` and then **re-run the entire
    setup block** — simply installing a package does not load it into the current session.

## Building a Multi-Period PowerFlowData Object

Multi-period power flow requires constructing a [`PowerFlowData`](@ref) object first.
This pre-allocates all matrices and working arrays for every time step at once, avoiding
repeated setup overhead.

Create a [`DCPowerFlow`](@ref) configured for 24 time steps:

```@repl uc_validation
pf = DCPowerFlow(; time_steps = 24)
data = PowerFlows.PowerFlowData(pf, sys)
```

`data` now holds pre-allocated injection and withdrawal arrays shaped `(n_buses, 24)`.

## Loading Dispatch Data

In a real workflow, per-interval bus injections and withdrawals come from your UC
results (e.g., extracted from a [`PowerSimulations.jl`](https://nrel-sienna.github.io/PowerSimulations.jl/stable/) `SimulationResults` object). Here we use the
default values already populated by `PowerFlowData` and apply a sinusoidal load
scale to simulate varying demand across the day:

```@repl uc_validation
base_injections  = copy(data.bus_active_power_injections[:, 1])
base_withdrawals = copy(data.bus_active_power_withdrawals[:, 1])

for t in 1:24
    load_scale = 0.8 + 0.2 * sin(2π * (t - 1) / 24)
    data.bus_active_power_injections[:, t]  .= base_injections
    data.bus_active_power_withdrawals[:, t] .= base_withdrawals .* load_scale
end
```

## Solving the Multi-Period Power Flow

Solve all 24 time steps in a single call. Using [`FlowReporting`](@ref).BRANCH_FLOWS reports
one row per physical branch by its [`PowerSystems.jl`](https://nrel-sienna.github.io/PowerSystems.jl/stable/) name, which lets us look up ratings directly
from the `System`:

```@repl uc_validation
results = solve_power_flow(data, sys, FlowReporting.BRANCH_FLOWS)
```

`results` is a `Dict{String, Dict{String, DataFrame}}`. The outer key is the time step
name (`"1"` through `"24"`). The inner dictionary has keys `"bus_results"`,
`"flow_results"`, and `"lcc_results"`.

## Inspecting Results

Look at bus results for hour 1:

```@repl uc_validation
results["1"]["bus_results"]
```

Notice that `Vm` (voltage magnitude) is 1.0 for all buses and `Q_gen`, `Q_load` are 0.
This is expected for DC power flow, which assumes flat voltage profiles and ignores
reactive power entirely.

Look at line flows for hour 1:

```@repl uc_validation
results["1"]["flow_results"]
```

Notice that `P_from_to` and `P_to_from` are equal and opposite (i.e.,
`P_to_from ≈ -P_from_to`) and `P_losses` is 0 for every branch. DC power flow assumes
lossless lines, so power entering a branch at one end equals power leaving at the other.

## Checking for Overloads

Build a branch rating lookup from the `System` — `flow_name` in the results matches
the [`PowerSystems.jl`](https://nrel-sienna.github.io/PowerSystems.jl/stable/) branch name when using [`FlowReporting`](@ref).BRANCH_FLOWS reporting:

```@repl uc_validation
ratings = Dict(
    PowerSystems.get_name(b) => PowerSystems.get_rating(b) * PowerSystems.get_base_power(sys)
    for b in PowerSystems.get_components(PowerSystems.ACBranch, sys)
)
```

Scan every interval for branches that exceed their rating:

```@repl uc_validation
overloads = DataFrame(
    time_step  = String[],
    flow_name  = String[],
    P_from_to  = Float64[],
    rating     = Float64[],
)

for (t, step_results) in results
    for row in eachrow(step_results["flow_results"])
        rating = get(ratings, row.flow_name, Inf)
        if abs(row.P_from_to) > rating
            push!(overloads, (t, row.flow_name, row.P_from_to, rating))
        end
    end
end

overloads
```

An empty DataFrame means the committed dispatch is network-feasible at every interval.
Non-empty rows indicate congestion the UC model missed — useful feedback for tightening
the network representation.
