# VSC converter + DC-network data model.
#
# Every PSY DC component (point-to-point `TwoTerminalVSCLine`, and — for multi-terminal grids —
# `InterconnectingConverter`/`DCBus`/`TModelHVDCLine`) lowers into ONE internal `DCNetwork`. The
# Newton solver only ever sees `DCNetwork`: converter active/reactive injections `(P_c, Q_c)` and
# free DC-node voltages `V_dc` are appended as tail unknowns after the bus and LCC blocks, mirroring
# the LCC tail-unknown pattern. M1 (point-to-point VSC) is the isolated-2-node special case; M2
# (multi-terminal DC) is the same struct with more nodes/branches and the same kernels.

# Converter control modes. An `Int8`-backed `@enum` stored directly on `DCNetwork`: reading
# `dcn.converter_mode[c]` is type-stable (concrete enum), so the residual/Jacobian hot path calls
# the mode-specific kernels (`_vsc_r1`/`_vsc_r2`/…) with no dynamic dispatch. The kernels branch on the
# enum value — cheap and branch-predictable for the handful of converters.
#   ControlPQ        r1: P_c − P_set            r2: Q_c − Q_set
#   ControlPVac      r1: P_c − P_set            r2: |V_ac|² − V_set²
#   ControlVdc       r1: V_dc − V_set           r2: Q_c − Q_set            (DC-slack converter)

# Keyword-constructed (`@kwdef`) so the 27-field build sites name every field — many fields share
# `Vector{Float64}`/`Matrix{Float64}` types, so positional construction would silently corrupt on a
# field reorder. All fields default to empty, so a bare `DCNetwork()` is the empty network used for
# pure-AC systems (regression-safe — pure AC is untouched).
"""
Internal lowering of all PSY DC components into a single DC network solved jointly with the AC
buses. Fields ordered: converters (length `n_conv`), DC nodes (length `n_node`), DC branches
(length `n_branch`). Built once from the `System` in [`initialize_DCNetwork!`](@ref) and stored on
`PowerFlowData` behind a `Ref` (the struct is immutable; the network is assigned after the system
is scanned, exactly like `solver_cache`).
