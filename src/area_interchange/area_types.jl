A PSY `Area` enrolled for embedded net-interchange control.

An AC branch whose endpoints straddle a controlled-area boundary (or touch one).

# Fields
- `from_bus_ix::Int`, `to_bus_ix::Int`: reduced-network bus indices.
- `nz_offsets::NTuple{4, Int}`: Ybus `nzval` offsets `Y11,Y12,Y21,Y22`.
- `metered_from::Bool`: metered end is the `from` bus.
- `from_area_tail::Int`: `tail_ix` of the controlled area owning the `from` bus; `0` = uncontrolled.
- `to_area_tail::Int`: `tail_ix` of the controlled area owning the `to` bus; `0` = uncontrolled.
- `diag_pollution::NTuple{2, ComplexF64}`: `(from, to)` correction so the kernel can recover
  the corridor's OWN self-admittance from the aggregate Y-bus diagonal, which sums EVERY
  branch/shunt incident at that bus, not just this tie's members. Cached once at tie-build
  time as `ybus_diag − Σ_{corridor members} y11/y22_primitive`; live evaluation then does
  `ybus_nzval[o[1]] − diag_pollution[1]` (and the `to`-side analog). This keeps flows exact
  under a controlled tap ON the corridor (the tap's own delta cancels against the live
  diagonal read, so live−constant stays exact) while still being exact for any static
  topology; a non-member device mutating an endpoint diagonal is out of scope and fenced by
  an enrollment-time `@warn` (see `enrollment.jl`), not corrected here.

"""
A converter whose AC bus sits in one controlled area while its DC counterpart terminal sits
in another — the DC-line analogue of `AreaTie`, carrying converter identity instead of a
Y-bus block: a DC converter's AC-side active-power injection (from `_lcc_ac_active_powers`,
or a VSC converter's `P_c` tail state) is what enters `NI_a`, not a branch flow read off Ybus.

Scope: `PSY.TwoTerminalLCCLine` and point-to-point `PSY.TwoTerminalVSCLine` only.
`PSY.InterconnectingConverter` (multi-terminal DC) is NOT enumerated — pairing a converter
with "the" other-area counterpart terminal is ambiguous on an N-terminal DC subnet (unlike a
point-to-point line's unambiguous from/to) and needs its own union-find-style traversal.

# Fields
- `kind::DCTieKind`: `DC_TIE_LCC` or `DC_TIE_VSC`.
- `lcc_ix::Int`: 1-based index into `data.lcc.*` (`data.lcc.bus_indices[lcc_ix] ==
  (from_bus_ix, to_bus_ix)`, rectifier="from"/inverter="to" always, independent of
  `setpoint_at_rectifier`); `0` when `kind == DC_TIE_VSC`.
- `from_conv_ix::Int`, `to_conv_ix::Int`: `DCNetwork` converter indices (`dcn.p_c`/`q_c` row)
  for the VSC line's from/to sides; both `0` when `kind == DC_TIE_LCC`.
- `from_bus_ix::Int`, `to_bus_ix::Int`: reduced-network AC bus indices of the two terminals.
- `metered_from::Bool`: metered end is the `from` terminal (mirrors `AreaTie`/`_metered_from`
  — same `ext["metered_end"]` convention, defaulting to `from`).
- `from_area_tail::Int`, `to_area_tail::Int`: owning-area tail indices; `0` = uncontrolled,
  exactly like `AreaTie`. A DC tie whose in-area terminal is that area's own SLACK bus is
  still emitted — `NI_a` and the bus's own power-balance row are independent residual rows,
  so there is no double-count to guard against.

    AreaInterchangeData

Holds the enrolled controlled areas and their ties for embedded net-interchange control.
Always present on [`PowerFlowData`](@ref) — empty vectors when control is off, mirroring
`data.lcc` with zero LCCs (no `Union{Nothing}` sentinel).

# Fields
- `areas::Vector{ControlledArea}`, `ties::Vector{AreaTie}`: the WORKING (currently
  enrolled) set — what the residual/Jacobian tail actually sees. The greedy relax loop
  shrinks these mid-solve on a non-converged time step; see
  `pristine_areas`/`pristine_ties` below for the set this is derived from.
- `dc_ties::Vector{DCTie}`: DC-line (LCC/VSC) ties, enumerated alongside `ties` by
  `build_area_ties` and consumed by the residual/Jacobian/relax machinery exactly like
  `ties`. Empty on any system with no cross-area DC converter (zero behavior change for
  AC-only systems).
- `tolerance::Float64`: interchange convergence tolerance.
- `ni_scratch::Vector{Float64}`: pre-allocated per-area net-interchange accumulator, length
  `length(areas)`, reused every residual evaluation by `_set_area_tail_residuals!` (see
  `area_residual.jl`) to avoid a per-iteration allocation on the hot path.
- `delta_p::Matrix{Float64}`: per-area, per-time-step `ΔP_a` mirror, sized
  `(length(areas), n_time_steps)`. Unlike `ni_scratch` this is NOT reset every call —
  `_update_residual_values!` writes the last-evaluated `ΔP_a` into it on every residual
  evaluation, and `update_state!` reads it back to seed a warm re-solve's `x0`; the
  per-time-step column keeps a multi-period `data`'s warm starts independent.
- `pristine_areas::Vector{ControlledArea}`, `pristine_ties::Vector{AreaTie}`,
  `pristine_dc_ties::Vector{DCTie}`: the FULL enrolled set as originally built by
  `build_area_interchange_data`, never mutated. Greedy relax shrinks only the WORKING set,
  for the rest of the CURRENT time step's attempts; `_ensure_pristine_area_set!` resets the
  working set from these before the next time step. Also the only source for a relaxed
  area's achieved net interchange in the results table, since its tail is translated to `0`
  out of the WORKING `ties` the moment it is de-enrolled.
- `pristine_delta_p::Matrix{Float64}`: persistent, PRISTINE-`tail_ix`-indexed mirror of
  `delta_p` — its row layout never changes under de-enrollment renumbering, so it survives
  across time steps. `_ensure_pristine_area_set!` reseeds the working `delta_p` from it;
  `_sync_pristine_delta_p!` writes back into it once a time step's solve converges.
- `relaxed::Dict{Int, Vector{RelaxedAreaRecord}}`: per-time-step record of areas relaxed
  away that time step (absent/empty = none), keyed by `time_step` so a multi-period
  `data`'s relax decisions stay independent.
