Per-iteration solver diagnostics (`log_solver_diagnostics`) and a fold /
voltage-collapse bail-out (`stop_at_fold`).

λ_min is taken on the bus-voltage Schur complement S = A − B·D⁻¹·C of the blocked
Jacobian J = [A B; C D], whose non-bus tail (LCC + VSC + area interchange,
`state_tail_length(data, dcn)` rows/cols) is the trailing block. The (1,1) block of
J⁻¹ is exactly S⁻¹, so v ↦ (J⁻¹·[v; 0])[1:nb] applies S⁻¹ from the *existing*
factorization of J — no second matrix or factorization. With no tail, S = J. The
monitor line and the bail-out share one refactor and one eigensolve via
`run_solver_diagnostics!`.

    BorderedFoldMonitor(n_state)

Fold monitor tracking `sign(det J)` through a bordered system. For fixed vectors
`b`, `c` and scalar `d`, border `J` as

    M = [ J   b
          cᵀ  d ]

The Schur complement gives `det(M) = det(J) · (d − cᵀJ⁻¹b)`, so with

    s = d − cᵀJ⁻¹b        g = 1/s = det(J) / det(M)

`g` is smooth along the continuation and vanishes exactly when `J` is singular:
`det M` is a fixed smooth function, nonzero near a simple fold for generic `b`, `c`,
so `sign(g)` differs from `sign(det J)` only by the constant factor `sign(det M)`. Therefore
**flips of `g` are flips of `det J`**: we can monitor which branch we're on via tracking `g`.

Cost per iteration: one back-solve `J y = b` against the *existing* factorization
plus a dot product.

`g` can flip sign two ways:

  - through **zero**: a genuine singularity of `J` — the fold;
  - through a **pole**: `det M` crossed zero. The bordering degenerated and `g` says
    nothing about `J`. The monitor re-picks `b`, `c` and restarts its sign tracking
    (it cannot recompute over past iterates, which are gone), up to
    `FOLD_MAX_BORDER_REPICKS` times before disabling itself.

The two are told apart by bisecting the *step* that produced the flip
(`_bracket_fold_flip!`): as the bracket tightens onto the event one determinant
vanishes there while the other stays continuous and nonzero, so `|g|` shrinks
geometrically onto a zero and grows onto a pole. Only that limiting *trend* is used.
The magnitude of `|g|` carries no usable information on its own — `|g| =
|det J|/|det M|`, and nothing pins `|det M|`, so a small `|g|` may mean a vanishing
`det J` or merely a swollen `det M`.

Bisection needs `residual` and `J` evaluated at the passed iterate: NR/TR supply one,
LM does not (its `J` lags the residual by a step). Without it a flip cannot be
classified at all and is read conservatively as a fold.
