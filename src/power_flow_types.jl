    NewtonRaphsonACPowerFlow <: ACPowerFlowSolverType

An [`ACPowerFlowSolverType`](@ref) corresponding to a basic Newton-Raphson iterative method.
The Newton step is taken verbatim at each iteration: no line search is performed.

Iwamoto step control can be enabled via `solver_settings = Dict(:iwamoto => true)` in
[`ACPowerFlow`](@ref). When enabled, each iteration checks whether the full Newton step
reduces the residual norm. If it does, the full step is accepted (overhead: 3 dot products).
If not, an optimal damping multiplier `μ` is computed by solving a cubic and the step
`x += μ·Δx` is applied instead, preventing divergence on ill-conditioned or
poorly-initialized systems.

Systems," IEEE Trans. PAS, 1981.

This is more robust than the basic Newton-Raphson method, but also more computationally

Marquardt diagonal column scaling (`√λ·D` damping instead of `√λ·I`) can be

An [`ACPowerFlowSolverType`](@ref) implementing fixed-slope decoupled Newton-Raphson (the classic
fast decoupled power flow). Constant approximate
Jacobian factor(s) are built once and reused across all iterations *and* time steps, while the
exact mismatches are evaluated every iteration. This trades the quadratic convergence rate of
Newton-Raphson for a linear rate at a fraction of the per-iteration cost — ideal for repeated

Works with all three AC formulations ([`ACPolarPowerFlow`](@ref),

- `V <: FDVariant`: [`FDDecoupled`](@ref) (classic B′/B″ half-iterations; polar only) or

    `FastDecoupledACPowerFlow` is used, the variant defaults per formulation: `FDDecoupled` for
    polar, `FDFixedJacobian` for rectangular/mixed.
- `S <: FDScheme`: B′/B″ scheme, [`FDSchemeXB`](@ref) (default) or [`FDSchemeBX`](@ref). Only
    meaningful for the [`FDDecoupled`](@ref) variant.

- `check_reactive_power_limits::Bool`: Whether to check reactive power limits during the power flow solution.
    Default is `false`.
- `exporter::Union{Nothing, PowerFlowEvaluationModel}`: An optional exporter for the power flow results.

- `calculate_voltage_stability_factors::Bool`: Whether to calculate voltage stability factors.
    Default is `false`.
- `generator_slack_participation_factors`: An optional parameter that specifies the participation
    factors for generator slack in the power flow solution. If `nothing`, all slack is picked up by
    the reference bus. If a `Dict{Tuple{DataType, String}, Float64}`, it should map
    `(component_type, component_name)` tuples to participation factors. If a `Vector` of such
    dictionaries, different participation factors can be used for different time steps. Default is `nothing`.
- `enhanced_flat_start::Bool`: Whether to use enhanced flat start initialization. Default is `true`.
- `robust_power_flow::Bool`: Whether to use run a DC power flow as a fallback if the initial residual is large.
    Default is `false`.
- `skip_redistribution::Bool`: Whether to skip slack redistribution. Default is `false`.
- `network_reductions::Vector{PNM.NetworkReduction}`: Network reductions to apply.
    Default is an empty vector. A `PNM.ZeroImpedanceBranchReduction` placed here is routed to
    PNM's dedicated zero-impedance step; set its `resistance_tolerance` to also merge
    near-zero-impedance branches that carry a tiny nonzero resistance (PSS/E-style).
- `time_steps::Int`: Number of time steps to solve. Default is `1`.
- `time_step_names::Vector{String}`: Names for each time step. Default is an empty vector.
- `correct_bustypes::Bool`: Whether to automatically correct bus types based on available generation.
    Default is `false`.
- `control_discrete_devices::Bool`: Whether to run discrete device control (tap changers, switched
    shunts) via λ-continuation. Default is `false`.
- `area_interchange_control::Bool`: Whether to embed PSS/E-style per-area net-interchange
    control in the AC solve (polar formulation; NR/TR/LM/FastDecoupled solvers).
    Default is `false`.
- `interchange_tolerance::Float64`: PTOL analogue (pu); used for validation and reporting only —
    the embedded formulation targets each area's PDES exactly. Non-positive values are floored to
    `MIN_INTERCHANGE_TOLERANCE` with a warning. Default is `DEFAULT_INTERCHANGE_TOLERANCE`.

An evaluation model for the AC power flow solved with the augmented

State per bus: PQ `(eᵢ, fᵢ)`, PV `(eᵢ, fᵢ, Qᵢ)`, REF `(P_genᵢ, Q_genᵢ)` with
`(eᵢ, fᵢ)` fixed. Residual is the complex current mismatch
`ΔIᵢ = I_specᵢ − Y_bus·V`. Off-diagonal Jacobian blocks ≡ Y_bus 2×2 real blocks
and are constant across iterations.

An evaluation model for a standard DC power flow.

This provides a fast approximate solution to the AC power flow problem, by solving for the 
bus voltage angles under some simplifying assumptions (lossless lines, constant voltage 
magnitudes, etc.). Branch flows are then calculated from the voltage angles. For details, see 
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-flow_study#DC_power_flow)
or section 4 of the [MATPOWER docs](https://matpower.org/docs/MATPOWER-manual-4.1.pdf).

# Arguments
- `exporter::Union{Nothing, PowerFlowEvaluationModel}`: An optional exporter for the power flow results.
    If not `nothing`, it should be a [`PSSEExportPowerFlow`](@ref). Default is `nothing`.
- `network_reductions::Vector{PNM.NetworkReduction}`: Network reductions to apply.
    Default is an empty vector. A `PNM.ZeroImpedanceBranchReduction` placed here is routed to
    PNM's dedicated zero-impedance step; set its `resistance_tolerance` to also merge
    near-zero-impedance branches that carry a tiny nonzero resistance (PSS/E-style).
- `time_steps::Int`: Number of time steps to solve. Default is `1`.
- `time_step_names::Vector{String}`: Names for each time step. Default is an empty vector.
- `correct_bustypes::Bool`: Whether to automatically correct bus types based on available generation.
    Default is `false`.
- `lossy_flows::Bool`: Controls how branch flows and losses are computed after solving
    for bus angles. When `true`, flows are computed from the full π-model arc admittance
    matrices (`Y_ft`, `Y_tf`), giving asymmetric `P_from_to` and `P_to_from`; losses are
    then `P_from_to + P_to_from` (exact real-power balance). When `false` (default),
    flows are computed from the lossless `BA·θ` formula (symmetric), and losses are
    approximated as `R·P²`.
- `generator_slack_participation_factors`: An optional parameter that specifies the participation
    factors for generator slack in the power flow solution. Same semantics as [`ACPolarPowerFlow`](@ref).
    Default is `nothing`.
- `distribute_slack_proportional_to_headroom::Bool`: Whether to distribute the slack proportional to
    generator headroom. Default is `false`.
- `skip_redistribution::Bool`: Whether to skip slack redistribution. Default is `false`.

- `distribute_slack_proportional_to_headroom::Bool`: Whether to distribute the slack proportional to
    generator headroom. Default is `false`.
- `skip_redistribution::Bool`: Whether to skip slack redistribution. Default is `false`.
