The objective is to reduce the firing/extinction angle to minimize reactive power (Q) demand.\n\nAs OLTCs operate typically over several seconds, the thyristor angles act as fast control. First, the thyristor angles respond to fast power flow changes. Afterwards, the OLTCs are adjusted to keep maintaining the power set point while also minimizing the thyristor angles.\n\nIn PSSE, the control using OLTCs is ignored in power flow calculations. Instead, PSSE adjusts the thyristor angles to represent the fast control.  PSSE solves for the rectifier firing angle (α) such that Idc = Iset, and for the inverter extinction angle (γ) such that Udc = Uset. The solver adjusts α and γ automatically to satisfy these setpoints and only switches control mode if a limit is violated.\n\nOLTC actions are not represented in the load-flow process because they operate on a slower time scale (seconds). The rationale is to provide a starting point for dynamic simulations. The tap positions can be set manually.\n\nFor safe operation and to avoid commutation failure, the rectifier should normally operate close to its minimum firing angle (α_min) with a small safety margin. Overly broad firing angle settings should be avoided. For example, setting max firing angle to 90° is too permissive. A narrower range encourages PSSE to adjust taps appropriately.\n\nIn PSSE, the variable VSched (scheduled DC voltage) represents the DC voltage reference, not the AC-side voltage. If VSched is set too low, the inverter will use unnecessarily large extinction angles (γ) to transfer power.\n\nPower flow calculation in PSSE often fails to converge with LCC. In this case, it can help to first run the Gauss-Seidel algorithm, then Newton will also converge in PSSE.","category":"section"},{"location":"reference/developers/lcc_model/#Implementation-in-Sienna","page":"Aspects of LCC implementation in PSSE","title":"Implementation in Sienna","text":"We implement the control logic of LCC based on the principle of maintaining the thyristor angles at their respective minimum limits, and using transformer tap adjustments for active power control. This control principle is better suited for representing realistic steady-state grid conditions.\n\nThe AC power flow calculation in Sienna is modified to directly solve for tap steps and thyristor angles of the LCC system. To this end, the state vector, the Jacobian matrix, the residuals are modified. The state vector is extended by 4 additional variables for each LCC system, namely 2 for tap positions and 2 for thyristor angles of the rectifier and inverter sides of the LCC system. The Jacobian matrix is extended by additional terms that represent the relevant partial derivatives. The residuals are extended by 4 terms per LCC system to match the additional state variables. The first two account for the active power set point and active power balance in the LCC system using the tap steps. The other two residual terms control for keeping the thyristor angles at their respective minimum limits. This approach follows the method in Panosyan, A. (2010). Modeling of Advanced Power Transmission System Controllers (PhD dissertation).\n\nThe complex apparent power for a rectifier or inverter is calculated as S = V * t * fracsqrt6pi * I_dc * e^j * phi, where V is the magnitude of AC voltage at the terminal, I_dc is the DC current in the LCC system (positive for flow direction rectifier to inverter, and vice versa), and phi is the angle between AC voltage and current.\n\nTo allow for the Jacobian implementation, a simplified calculation of the angle between the AC current and voltage at the LCC terminals was used. The equation below represents the calculation used for the angle:\n\n$\n\n\\phi = arccos(cos(\\alpha) * sign(I{dc}) - \\frac{x * I{dc}}{\\sqrt{2} * t * V}) $\n\nIn the equation above, the variable alpha represents the thyristor angle.

The Jacobian matrix is used in power flow analysis to represent the partial derivatives of bus active and reactive power injections with respect to bus voltage magnitudes and angles.\n\nUnlike some commonly used approaches where the Jacobian matrix is constructed as four submatrices, each grouping values for the four types of partial derivatives, this function groups the partial derivatives by bus. The structure is organized as groups of 4 values per bus. See the example below for details.\n\nThis approach is more memory-efficient. Furthermore, this structure results in a more efficient factorization because the values are more likely to be grouped close to the diagonal. Refer to Electric Energy Systems: Analysis and Operation by Antonio Gomez-Exposito and Fernando L. Alvarado for more details.\n\nThe function initializes three arrays (rows, columns, and values) to store the row indices, column indices, and values of the non-zero elements of the Jacobian matrix, respectively.\n\nFor each bus in the system, the function iterates over its neighboring buses and determines the type of each neighboring bus (REF, PV, or PQ).  Depending on the bus type, the function adds the appropriate entries to the Jacobian matrix structure.\n\nFor REF buses, entries are added for local active and reactive power.\nFor PV buses, entries are added for active and reactive power with respect to angle, and for local reactive power.\nFor PQ buses, entries are added for active and reactive power with respect to voltage magnitude and angle.\n\nFor example, suppose we have a system with 3 buses: bus 1 is REF, bus 2 is PV, and bus 3 is PQ. Let ΔPⱼ, ΔQⱼ be the active, reactive power balance at the jth bus. Let Pⱼ and Qⱼ be the active and reactive power generated at the jth bus (REF and PV only). Then the state vector is [P₁, Q₁, Q₂, θ₂, V₃, θ₃], and the Jacobian matrix is\n\n| ∂ΔP₁/∂P₁ | ∂ΔP₁/∂Q₁ | ∂ΔP₁/∂Q₂ | ∂ΔP₁/∂θ₂ | ∂ΔP₁/∂V₃ | ∂ΔP₁/∂θ₃ |   | ∂ΔQ₁/∂P₁ | ∂ΔQ₁/∂Q₁ | ∂ΔQ₁/∂Q₂ | ∂ΔQ₁/∂θ₂ | ∂ΔQ₁/∂V₃ | ∂ΔQ₁/∂θ₃ | | ∂ΔP₂/∂P₁ | ∂ΔP₂/∂Q₁ | ∂ΔP₂/∂Q₂ | ∂ΔP₂/∂θ₂ | ∂ΔP₂/∂V₃ | ∂ΔP₂/∂θ₃ | | ∂ΔQ₂/∂P₁ | ∂ΔQ₂/∂Q₁ | ∂ΔQ₂/∂Q₂ | ∂ΔQ₂/∂θ₂ | ∂ΔQ₂/∂V₃ | ∂ΔQ₂/∂θ₃ | | ∂ΔP₃/∂P₁ | ∂ΔP₃/∂Q₁ | ∂ΔP₃/∂Q₂ | ∂ΔP₃/∂θ₂ | ∂ΔP₃/∂V₃ | ∂ΔP₃/∂θ₃ | | ∂ΔQ₃/∂P₁ | ∂ΔQ₃/∂Q₁ | ∂ΔQ₃/∂Q₂ | ∂ΔQ₃/∂θ₂ | ∂ΔQ₃/∂V₃ | ∂ΔQ₃/∂θ₃ |\n\nIn reality, for large networks, this matrix would be sparse, and each 2x2 block would only be nonzero when there's a line between the respective buses.\n\nFinally, the function constructs a sparse matrix from the collected indices and values and returns it.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"reference/api/internal/#PowerFlows._create_jacobian_matrix_structure_bus!-Tuple{Vector{Int32}, Vector{Int32}, Vector{Float64}, Int64, Int64, Int64, Int64, Int64, Int64, Val{ACBusTypes.PV = 2}}","page":"Internal API Reference","title":"PowerFlows._create_jacobian_matrix_structure_bus!","text":"Create the Jacobian matrix structure for a PV bus.
